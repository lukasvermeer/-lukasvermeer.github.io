## My specialty

As an experienced experimentation practitioner, my specialty is designing and building the infrastructure and processes required to start and scale A/B testing to drive business growth. I combine industry experience in online experimentation and data science with an academic background in computing science and machine learning. For eight years, I was responsible for A/B testing at Booking.com, widely acknowledged leader in online experimentation. I grew the Booking.com in-house experimentation team from four to thirty people, and became the first Director of Experimentation in the company.

As an acknowledged leader in the field of online experimentation, I have co-authored multiple influential academic [papers](/publications/) on the topic of online experimentation. I have [spoken](/speaking/) at 30+ conferences, including Growth Marketing Summit, CXL Live, and Google Catalyst Conference, SIGIR and KDD. I have accepted two [Experimentation Culture Awards](https://experimentationcultureawards.com/); once on behalf of Booking.com and once on behalf of the [Vista Experimentation Hub](https://vista.io/blog/building-a-culture-of-experimentation). My impact was recognised in the Harvard Business Review story “[Building a Culture of Experimentation](https://hbr.org/2020/03/building-a-culture-of-experimentation)” (March - April 2020 issue).


Currently I am employed as Director of Experimentation at Vista. I am also available as a freelance consultant and [speaker](/speaking/) to help businesses grow their experimentation culture.

## How I can help you

As a trusted advisor, I play an essential role in making A/B testing an integrated part of business processes. I advocate for accessibility of experimentation, helping people from any background (product owners, designers, developers, writers) to make the right decisions.

You can hire me to help you find answers to questions such as:

- How do we start?
- How do we scale?
- What are the common pitfalls and mistakes in A/B testing and beyond?
- How to ensure that experimentation takes the right place in your company culture?

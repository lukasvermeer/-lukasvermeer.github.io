## My specialty

As an experienced experimentation practitioner, my specialty is designing and building the infrastructure and processes required to start and scale A/B testing to drive business growth. I combine industry experience in online experimentation and data science with an academic background in computing science and machine learning. For eight years, I was responsible for A/B testing at Booking.com, widely acknowledged leader in online experimentation. I grew the Booking.com in-house experimentation team from four to thirty people, and became the first Director of Experimentation in the company.

As an acknowledged leader in the field of online experimentation, I have co-authored multiple influential academic [papers](/publications/) on the topic of online experimentation. I have [spoken](/speaking/) at 30+ conferences, including Growth Marketing Summit, CXL Live, and Google Catalyst Conference, SIGIR and KDD. I have accepted two [Experimentation Culture Awards](https://experimentationcultureawards.com/); once on behalf of Booking.com and once on behalf of the [Vista Experimentation Hub](https://vista.io/blog/building-a-culture-of-experimentation). My impact was recognised in the Harvard Business Review story “[Building a Culture of Experimentation](https://hbr.org/2020/03/building-a-culture-of-experimentation)” (March - April 2020 issue).


Currently I am employed as Director of Experimentation at Vista. I am also available as a freelance [speaker](/speaking/) and consultant to help businesses grow their experimentation culture.

## How I can help you

As a trusted advisor, I play an essential role in making A/B testing an integrated part of business processes. I advocate for accessibility of experimentation, helping people from any background (product owners, designers, developers, writers) to make the right decisions.

You can hire me to help you find answers to questions such as:

- How do we start?
- How do we scale?
- What are the common pitfalls and mistakes in A/B testing and beyond?
- How to ensure that experimentation takes the right place in your company culture?

### “4.9 on a scale of 1 to 5”

*I recently invited Lukas to deliver a talk on Experimentation at our internal event with senior Data Science leaders from portfolio companies of Prosus.*

*It was a pleasure to engage with him from the first go. He took time to understand our context and audience, to assess what level of details would be needed and what value he could bring to the table. He even shared some pre-read material, and suggested for participants to take a survey on experimentation growth to understand where they stand. This exercise was very useful for our group.*

*And finally, he delivered a great session with various learning points for even most senior leaders in the group. There were moments when people literally shouted that this is a great piece of information that they learned today. His talk touched at topics related to experimentation, both at an organisation/culture and technical level. On a survey, we did at the end of session, his talk was highly rated. It got a score of 4.9 on a scale of 1 to 5. Lukas is clearly an expert on experimentation and I would recommend him very strongly to anyone looking for an advice on that topic.*

### “A wise mind easy to work with”

*Lukas has a unique perspective on the future of our industry. His vision for lean operation is effective to scale experimentation. The advisor mindset will influence frameworks. 
Past stories strengthen arguments and move decisions faster.*

*Lukas helped my team prioritize and move our experimentation flywheel faster. Generating interest and reducing the cost of testing were our most impactful projects. A wise mind easy to work with.*

### “Very crisp, clear, and fact-based”

*We invited Lukas for a 7 x 1 hour [office hours] sessions engagement to learn from his experience about building democratized experimentation at Booking.com. Lukas's insights were very crisp, clear, and fact-based. He helped our team understand what we were lacking in helping build a powerful experimentation platform and how we can scale our platform to the next level.*

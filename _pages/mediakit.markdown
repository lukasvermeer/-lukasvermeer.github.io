## Data Science vs. Data Alchemy

{% include video id="wcNwUNqTYc8" provider="youtube" %}

[Data Science vs. Data Alchemy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wcNwUNqTYc8) at [GOTO Conference](https://gotopia.tech/) (2016).

> The "Big Data" and "Data Science" rhetoric of recent years seems to focus mostly on collecting, storing and analysing existing data. Data which many seem to think they have "too much of" already. However, the greatest discoveries in both science and business rarely come from analysing things that are already there. True innovation starts with asking Big Questions. Only then does it become apparent which data is needed to find the answers we seek.

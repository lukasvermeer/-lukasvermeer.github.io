I was interviewed for the [CRO Cafe](https://www.cro.cafe/podcast/datascience-can-do-what) podcast.

> This is a bonus episode with Emily Robinson (Senior Data Scientist at Warby Parker) and Lukas Vermeer (Director of Experimentation at Booking.com). In her earlier session that day, Emily said that real progress starts when you put your work online for others to see and comment on which in this case was about Github. Someone from the audience wondered how that works out in larger companies where a manager or even a legal department might not be overly joyous about that to say the least so I asked Emily about her thoughts on that.

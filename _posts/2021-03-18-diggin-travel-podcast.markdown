I was interviewed for the [Diggin Travel](https://diggintravel.com/travel-digital-products-booking-com-case/) podcast.

> Booking.com is a leader in experimentation and in building great travel digital products. However, for most airlines and travel companies, it seems like Booking.com is two or three steps ahead. When we benchmark digital optimization maturity here at Diggintravel, we see most airlines starting to integrate experimentation in their digital product development process. But how can airlines scale up their experimentation and digital optimization process? How can you make it a core part of your digital product development?

> I asked Lukas, based on his learnings so far, what would be his advice on how to democratize experimentation? How can it be scaled to enable airlines to do experimentation at a larger scale?

I was interviewed for the [1,000 Experiments Club](https://www.abtasty.com/blog/1000-experiments-club-lukas-vermeer/) podcast.

> Lukas spoke with AB Tastyâ€™s VP of Marketing Marylin Montoya about the process and culture of experimentation; from the methods to the roles of the teams involved within an organization. Here are some of the key insights from their conversation.
